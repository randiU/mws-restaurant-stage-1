## Project Overview

This is a project included in the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree program. The goal is to take a website that is unresponsive, lacks accessibility, and does not work offline, and update it to become a responsive, accessible, and offline ready website. 

## App Description

The user can visit the Restaurant Reviews website and choose a restaurant based on a specific neighborhood/location and what cuisine they are interested in. Once this information has been provided, they will be provided with a list of possible restaurants. Once they pick a restaurant, they will be taken to a page specific to the restaurant and can see reviews associted with that restaurant, hours of operation, and address information. 


## How to run the App

1. Download or clone the repository on your computer 
	- `https://github.com/randiU/restaurant-review-app.git`
2. Launch a local client server using Python from your terminal:
	- Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` 
	- Python 3: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
